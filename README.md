This README provides instructions on how to reproduce the results presented in the Final Project report.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have access to the PINOT database. This requires having a valid username and password for the database that should be filled in:
host = "###"
database = "###"
user = "###"
password = "###"
port = "###"

Make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
1. **Python 3.8+** - Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.
2. **Required Python Libraries**:
